CoopCycle
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web)

CoopCycle is a **self-hosted** platform to order meals in your neighborhood and get them delivered by bike couriers. The only difference with proprietary platforms as Deliveroo or UberEats is that this software is [reserved to co-ops](#license).

The main idea is to **decentralize** this kind of service and to allow couriers to **own the platform** they are working for.
In each city, couriers are encouraged to organize into co-ops, and to run their very own version of the software.

The software is under active development. If you would like to contribute we will be happy to hear from you! All instructions are [in the Contribute file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Coopcycle-web is the main repo, containing the web API, the front-end for the website and the dispatch algorithm : [Â Technical Overview ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Technical-Overview). You can see it in action & test it here : https://demo.coopcycle.org

You can find a comprehensive list of our repos here : [ Our repos comprehensive list ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Our-repos-comprehensive-list).

How to run a local instance
--------------

### Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

    - On OSX : use [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`. It doesn't rely on Virtualbox as Docker used to.

    - On Windows : use [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`. Depending on your platform, Docker could be installed as Native or you have to install Docker toolbox which use VirtualBox instead of Hyper-V causing a lot a differences in implementations. If you hace the luck to have a CPU that support native Dockern you can [share your hard disk as a virtual volume for your appliances](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevelasker/2016/06/14/configuring-docker-for-windows-volumes/).

    You will need to download openssl for generating certificates.
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm
    The make script suppose that both are found [in your Path environment variable](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).

    - On Linux : follow [the instructions for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). `docker-compose` binary is to be installed independently. You can use Coopcycle without root privileges, to do so run `sudo usermod -aG docker your-user` (will add you to the `docker` group).


* Run the install scripts - when asked for `app/config/parameters.yml` parameters please enter your Google (`google_api_key`) and Stripe test (`stripe_secret_key` and `stripe_publishable_key`) credentials, for others you can keep defaults.
```sh
make install
```
    -On Windows: run `powershell make.ps1` in powershell.

### Run the application

* Start the Docker containers
```
docker-compose up
```

* Open the platform in your browser
```
open http://localhost
```

Testing
-------

* Create the test database

```
docker-compose run php bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test
```

* Launch the PHPUnit tests

```
make phpunit
```

* Launch the Behat tests

```
make behat
```

* Launch the Mocha tests

```
make mocha
```

Running migrations
-------

When pulling change from the remote, the database models may have changed. To apply the changes, you will need to run a database migration.

```
make migrations-migrate
```
